## Most Popular Electric Car Brand in Washington, USA. ## 

In this project, we as a group of data journalists have looked at data identifying the most popular electric car companies in the state of Washington, USA. This repository includes three graphs to visualize the data in the clearest way possible. In the first, the three companies Tesla, Ford, and Chevrolet are displayed in their abundance over a map of the state. We concluded that Tesla is the most popular electric car company overall. The second graph displays the counties in Washington with the highest proportion of Tesla vehicles. Finally, a bubble plot displays the most popular Tesla model in each county in Washington.

Given the growing demand for electric vehicles, the BBC should take this data into consideration and study it not only in Washington but also internationally. When it comes to understanding climate change and taking action to cut emissions, this data is integral. Furthermore, the visualization of such data promotes the idea of 'open science' and creates more accessible forms of such information. The knowledge will enable us to identify the most well-liked companies and increase their accessibility to a wider audience.

**Rules of the Repository**
----
This repository is accessible to the public. However,  we ask that no edits be made to any of the code, plots, or formatting. 
The repository and the data can be used for educational purposes as stated in the License file, as well as evidence for future advances in the field.

The **License file** and the **Instructions** initially given by the Teaching Team have been linked below and can be found in the main repository as well. 
- **[License file](https://github.com/EdDataScienceEES/challenge-2-challenge-2-group-4/blob/fd8248eb02878fc444f8af3d406a05c493985039/LICENSE)**
- **[Instructions from Teaching Team](https://github.com/EdDataScienceEES/challenge-2-challenge-2-group-4/blob/e8dae373a15dcf20cbb50477762b7b5bcfd4efdb/Starting%20files%20/Class_Instructions.md)**
  
**Coding Etiquette**
- In all code scripts, snake case is used which appears as 'snake_case'. 
- In all coding files the comments are done with a hashtag.
- Title comments are done with "#__" (hashtag with 2 spaces after).
- Comments for individual lines of code are done with #_ then a capital letter, two spaces from the end of the line of code.
- Four dashes "----" make the code collapsable for neatness.
- The working directory is set at the start of each script, followed by the importing of libraries. 

**Contents** 
---
This is a guide for navigation of the repository. 
The folder [Starting files](https://github.com/EdDataScienceEES/challenge-2-challenge-2-group-4/tree/f9b0adaa65cf9d9b244e6d46112fd452e1d0ed5d/Starting%20files%20) contains the original instructions given by the teaching team as linked above, and the original dataset. 

The folder [Final script](https://github.com/EdDataScienceEES/challenge-2-challenge-2-group-4/tree/master/Final%20script) contains the script with all code.

The folder [Final plots](https://github.com/EdDataScienceEES/challenge-2-challenge-2-group-4/tree/master/Final%20Plots) contains the plots created in R studio and explain the data. 

**Plots**
---
![grid](https://github.com/EdDataScienceEES/challenge-2-challenge-2-group-4/blob/master/Final%20Plots/grid.png)
**Figure 1** (left) is a GoogleMaps extract of the state of Washington, showing the most popular models of electric vehicles in each county. **Figure 2** (middle) is a map showing the counties of Washington. The colour gradient shows the count of Tesla model electric vehicles in each county. **Figure 3** (right) is a bubble plot showing the occurrence of various models of Tesla electric vehicles in the three WA counties in which they are most prevalent. The x-axis shows the model of Tesla vehicle, and the y-axis shows the three county names. The bubble plot is used to ensure reader friendliness and easy interpretation.
