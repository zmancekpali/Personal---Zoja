summary(france1_mbrms)
#The interesting part is what is written under Population-Level Effects. The model gives us an 
#Estimate aka the mean of our posterior distribution for each variable. As explained earlier, these estimates 
#can be used as the intercept and slope for the relationship between our two variables. Est.Error is the error 
#associated with those means (the standard error). The other important part of that summary is the 95%
#Credibility Interval (CI), which tells us the interval in which 95% of the values of our posterior distribution 
#fall. The thing to look for is the interval between the values of l-95% CI and u-95% CI. If this interval is 
#strictly positive or negative, we can assume that the effect is significant (and positive or negative respectively). 
#However, if the interval encompasses 0, then we can’t be sure that the effect isn’t 0, aka non-significant. In addition, 
#the narrower the interval, the more precise the estimate of the effect. In our case, the slope 95% CI does not 
#encompass 0 and it is strictly positive, so we can say that time has a significantly positive effect on red knot abundance.

plot(france1_mbrms)
#We call this the trace or caterpillar plots. If you focus on the right hand plots, you want to see a sort of 
#fuzzy caterpillar, or a festive tinsel. If this is the case, it means your model explored all the possible 
#values it could look at, so it convergedwell. On the x-axis of those trace plots, we have the iterations done after the warmup 
#(so 3000-1000 = 2000 in our case). And on the y-axis are all the values of the mean of the posterior 
#distribution that have been assessed by our model. On the left side, the density plots shows all of those mean 
#values again, plotted by the amount of times the model got this value (so the distribution of means basically). 
#And if you look closely, the mean of this density plot is going to be the mean value that has been found by the 
#model most often, so probably the most “correct” one. And that value should be very close to the actual estimate
#that the summary function gave us. In our case, the top plot is the intercept and that density plot seems to be 
#centered around 8.70, which is the estimate value that we got in the summary!
