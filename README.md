# Personal Repo - Zoja

My personal repo - includes all the code to my undergraduate dissertation and additional files which contain past coding files from my undergraduate studies.

If you are interested in seeing my dissertation work:
- My full thesis can be found [here](https://github.com/zmancekpali/Personal---Zoja/blob/main/Dissertation/Dissertation.pdf)
- The code for all of the statistical analysis on my dissertation data can be found [here](https://github.com/zmancekpali/Personal---Zoja/blob/main/Dissertation/Dissertation.R)

Alternatively, if you are interested in my other coding work:
- The [Data Science Folder](https://github.com/zmancekpali/Personal---Zoja/tree/main/Data%20Science%20for%20EES%20Course) contains all of my work done during the Data Science for Ecological and Environmental Sciences undergraduate course at the University of Edinburgh, including my own [coding tutotial](https://github.com/zmancekpali/Personal---Zoja/tree/main/Data%20Science%20for%20EES%20Course/Data%20Science%20Tutorial)
- Any additional coursework involving coding can be found [here](https://github.com/zmancekpali/Personal---Zoja/tree/main/UoE%20Courses)
- You can also see my ever-evolving script of common and useful bits of code I use regularly [here](https://github.com/zmancekpali/Personal---Zoja/blob/main/Useful%20Code/Collection%20of%20useful%20things/Collection.R)

## Coding etiquette for this repository:
The following rules should be upheld at all times when coding or working in this repo:
1. Informative comments are included throughout the code, using the hashtag (#) symbol. There are no spaces before the hashtags. 
2. The code is spaced out to make it easier to read.
3. The work is broken down into sections (by adding ---- at the end of each section title if necessary).
4. All objects are given informative names (object names do not include capital leters and are separated by _ if necessary).
5. Keep your code to under 100 characters in length per line (comments can extend past that if necessary).
