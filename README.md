# Personal Repo - Zoja

My personal repo - includes all the code to my undergraduate dissertation and additional files which contain past coding files from my undergraduate studies. 


## Coding etiquette for this repository:
The following rules should be upheld at all times when coding or working in this repo:
1. Informative comments are included throughout the code, using the hashtag (#) symbol. There are no spaces before the hashtags. 
2. The code is spaced out to make it easier to read.
3. The work is broken down into sections (by adding ---- at the end of each section title if necessary).
4. All objects are given informative names (object names do not include capital leters and are separated by _ if necessary).
5. Keep your code to under 100 characters in length per line (comments can extend past that if necessary).
